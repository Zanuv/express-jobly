# Jobly Backend

## Part One: Setup / Starter Code
1. Download the starter code. Do a quick skim of the code to get a sense of the main components and the organization.
2. Set up the provided `jobly.sql` database and test database.
3. Read the tests and get an understanding of what the `beforeEach` and `afterEach` methods are doing.
4. Run the tests with coverage using the `-i` flag for Jest.
5. Start up the server on port 3001.
6. Test the API in Insomnia.

### First Task: `sqlForPartialUpdate`
1. Write unit tests for `sqlForPartialUpdate`.
2. Thoroughly document the function.


This is the Express backend for Jobly, version 2.

To run this:

    node server.js
    
To run the tests:

    jest -i
